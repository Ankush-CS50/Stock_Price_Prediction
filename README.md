# Stock_Price_Prediction
This is a python notebook that allows any user to speculate the price of any India or US Stock based on it's previous performance.

Please note, previous performance can't guarantee future returns.

Features

1. Dynamic Entry of the name of the stock before running the file. They can simply replace 'AAPL' with the name of the stock that they want to speculate and start running the code pieces one by one.

2. The program can either be hosted on cloud by using Google Colaboratory or can be donwloaded to run locally. I am currently working to integrate it with Streamlit and create an interactive web app on top of it.

3. It's easy to use, just a click on the play button and you're good to go.

4. We are using Tiingo API to pick the prices of Stocks. You can use any API like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance and so one, supported by Pandas Datareader.

5. Best alternatives to services like Tickertape in terms of Stock analysis.

6. High performance, since it's running on powerful servers of Google Colab.

7. None of the files leaves the instance or your local system. I literally have no access to your data. So, it doesn't hurts your privacy.

8. Fully Open-Source.
